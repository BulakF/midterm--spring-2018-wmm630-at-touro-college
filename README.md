# Midterm | WMM630 | Graduate School of Technology | Touro College


For the midterm project, you will begin creating your brand as a designer. This will include a logo, designs for stationery, and mocks for a web site. 

## Gather Your Assets
Before designing anything, choose a color palette, a font pairing that provides fonts for both desktop and web, decide on container sizes for desktop, tablet, and mobile web designs, and choose a grid.

## Create Your Logo

Create a logo for your brand that you’ll use in your stationery and web site. Along with your colored version, also create a version using neutrals.

## Your Profile Picture
If you intend to use a picture of yourself in your branding, use a picture with a high face-ism ratio, somewhere on the order of .75. A classic portrait’s face-ism ratio is .5.

## Stationery

Produce designs for a full suite of stationery. This includes 8 1/2" × 11" paper, #10 envelopes, business cards, thank you notes, and envelopes for the thank you notes. If you’re an international student, also create designs for the paper and envelope sizes most popular in your home country.

## Web Design Comp
Create design comprehensives, or comps, for your web site. For the midterm, you only need to provide a single page per device: one for desktop, one for tablet, and one for mobile, totaling three pages. For a guideline on how to prepare a web site, from the guidelines phase up to the design phase, see [this repo](https://github.com/code-warrior/midterm--spring-2018-web-design-1-at-queens-college).

## Compiling Your Presentation File
You’ll need to compile all your artboards/slides/images into a single PDF called `presentation.pdf` or a Keynote file called `presentation.key`. Before doing so, ensure that the size of each artboard/slide/image is as small as possible. **Your final presentation file may not be larger than 25MB. This repo will reject files that exceed that limit.**

Make sure **to exclude** working files, such as `.ai`, `.psd`, `.sketch`, or `.indd` files, in your submission.
